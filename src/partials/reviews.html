                    <p>Overall, this is a very, very good donut shop, better than the ones in Portland (Oregon) because they keep it simple, but damn good.</p>

                    <p>Last time I have visited a cooking course by Eva 
                        I was impressed with the way she explained everything
                        to people. You can be sure you will manage to cook a delicious dish even if it is your first time in the kitchen!
                        Thank you so much for the masterclass! Looking forward to the next one and highly recommend it to everyone!</p>

                    <p>GLUTEN FREE DONUTS!!!  My personal favorite was the maple bacon.  Each gluten free donut was between $4-4.50 each.</p>

                    <p>The Coffee tastes great , everything is great and really good service.  Happy to recommend this cafe.   Sometimes I have to wait for a seat but they always do all they can to seat people ASAP, just that they are busy. A+ for service.</p>

                    <p>Nice little spot in Cas Square. I choose to come there because you always get fast, friendly service. Great value for money, good coffee, and my 4 year old loves the generous sized babychino. The cinnamon donuts are light and crispy - different experience to supermarket donuts</p>

                    <p>Under new management. They do a good job at this franchise. The hot dogs are good, the donuts are good. The coffee was tasty and a good temperature. The staff are delightful.  The hotdog coffee and donut deal is great value for $10!</p>

                    <p>Donut king Cas. Went early donuts were very fresh and nice. Had a hotdog also quite nice and made fresh (as fresh as a hotdog can be made lol) staff were very friendly and informed me and fixed a mistake they made with my order. Very happy.</p>

                    <p>How can I give a poor review for this tasty franchise? The donuts where delicious and cooked quickly. The staff could be more cheerful</p>
